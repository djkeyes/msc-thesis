\chapter{Introduction}
\label{cha:introduction}


Things to cover:
-overview of DSO
-failure case for DSO: pure rotation causes tracking failure. needs relocalization to recover previous scale.
-comment on semi-dense vs dense methods, advantages vs disadvantages
	-high quality depth maps even from monocular video, whereas other techniques use stereo, structured light cameras, lidar, etc
-maybe some background on deep learning, CNNs, descriptor learning, etc
-maybe some background on image retrieval systems, kd trees vs bag of words, robust camera pose estimation, etc


-Experiments:
-description of each dataset
-for each TUM dataset:
	-run DSO on video
	-align first half of video to ground truth
	-compute visual odometry error of second half of video
		-DSO shows some kind of color-coded error
		-LSD-slam shows absolute trajectory error (computed as RMSE)
		-7scenes papers typically show num frames localized within some threshold
		-either compute this over just keyframes, or also over intermediate poses
	-compute sift descriptors at each keyframe
		-cluster descriptors (probably only for first video?)
	-feed training data to (initialized) neural net
	-compute dense descriptors at each keyframe
	    -cluster descriptors (I guess separately for each video)
	-create discloc database using frames in first half of video
    -for each frame in the second half of the video, relocalize against first frame
	    -for each relocalized pose, compute same errors as before
-for each 7scenes dataset:
	-run DSO on each video
	-try to align to ground truth, but fail
	-compute sift descriptors at each keyframe
	-feed training data from training videos to (un-initialized?) neural net
	-compute dense descriptors at each keyframe
	-cluster descriptors
	-create discloc database--use all train videos somehow? need to store which video is which so we can re-align later.
	-for each frame in the test videos, relocalize against train set
	    -for each relocalized pose, compute num frames localized withing threshold
-for each cambridge landmarks dataset:
	-do same thing as DSO, if there's time.

	
	-dk's questions:
		-how does size of visual vocab affect?
		-what can we do to improve descriptors? dilation? better training examples?
		-effect of merging descriptors of coobserved points? (not yet implemented)
